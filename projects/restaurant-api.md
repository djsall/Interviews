# Restaurant API

## The task

This application is housing restaurants and their menu items. The API is made available to the client via
authentication, to place orders to the restaurants.

API users can:
- list, view `Restaurants` and with their menu items.
- CRUD `Orders` with appropriate menu items to all `Restaurants`

Make sure, that the restaurant can only receive orders with their own menu items.

The project should automatically generate a working OpenAPI document.
